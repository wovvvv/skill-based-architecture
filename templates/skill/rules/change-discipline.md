# Change Discipline

Read this once before the first mutation in a modifying workflow. It owns mutation safety; task workflows keep only their trigger, immediate action, and completion responsibility.

## Semantic Boundary

- Establish the invariant, source of truth, ownership/provenance, producer-to-consumer chain, and affected full/incremental/read/write paths before choosing repair depth.
- Default to Product Development: make the smallest semantically complete change at the boundary that owns the invariant. Dependency count is risk evidence, not permission to preserve an incomplete repair.
- Use Operational Stabilization only for an explicit incident, availability, hotfix, or frozen-scope constraint; make containment reversible and report the structural repair still open.

## Mutation Boundary

- Touch only task-owned files; preserve unrelated local changes and existing style.
- Read applicable skill-root `rules/project-rules.md` ([local file](project-rules.md)) and `rules/coding-standards.md` ([local file](coding-standards.md)) only when the planned mutation reaches their scope. Do not preload unrelated rule files.
- Update canonical sources before generated/copied consumers, and use the owning sync path rather than hand-editing derived output.
- Avoid unrelated renaming, formatting, cleanup, or deletion. Remove only artifacts made obsolete by the requested change.
- Do not mutate until the requested outcome is concrete enough to verify and every required business decision is resolved.

## Check

Can every changed line be traced to the requested outcome, an affected semantic path, or a required generated/validation target, with unrelated work preserved?
