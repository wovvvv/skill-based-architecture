# Requirement Definition Workflow

Use this workflow when the requested deliverable is to understand, discuss,
brainstorm, correct, or confirm desired behavior before implementation planning.
Ordinary feature and behavior-change workflows may enter it internally when
their requirement is incomplete; the user never has to re-route or restate the
request. This workflow produces `requirement-ready` and, only under its own
Artifact Pressure Gate, the Governing Requirement artifact. It never produces
an implementation Plan, Task Breakdown, code mutation, or proof command.

[`change-contract.md`](../protocol-blocks/change-contract.md) is the sole owner of Requirement Contract dimensions, authority, readiness, and return states.
This workflow owns only the evidence and interaction needed to complete that
contract.

## Intake And Evidence

1. Preserve the user's clear wording as the normative source. Consume an
   existing issue, PRD, accepted decision, or governing Requirement directly
   when it already has authority; do not manufacture a duplicate document or
   confirmation turn.
2. Evaluate only the Requirement Contract dimensions activated by this request.
   Do not turn goal, scope, model/flow, rules, constraints, and acceptance into
   a fixed questionnaire or require irrelevant fields.
3. Inspect the smallest code, documentation, configuration, test, runtime, or
   prior-decision evidence that can resolve the current uncertainty. Use
   [`source-localization.md`](../protocol-blocks/source-localization.md) for an
   Agent-discoverable owner, path, symbol, Current behavior, feasibility, cost,
   or risk. Code may constrain or falsify a premise; it cannot choose desired product meaning for the user.
4. Separate confirmed normative input, current implementation facts, Agent
   assumptions, real risks/conflicts, and unresolved choices. Inference may
   generate candidates but never creates requirement authority.

## Readiness Paths

### Clear Requirement

When explicit input already closes every activated user-owned choice, record
the source-faithful Requirement Contract and return `requirement-ready`
immediately. Do not require the user to reply with a ceremonial confirmation.
Keep it Session-only unless the Artifact Pressure Gate below admits a Governing
Requirement. Do not create a Task Anchor or implementation Plan here.

### Incomplete Requirement

When a remaining normative choice could change the goal, scope, preserved
behavior, model or flow, rule or constraint, permission, or acceptance:

1. present the current understanding in concrete outcome terms;
2. name only evidence-backed risk, conflict, or materially different meaning;
3. ask the minimum normative question needed to choose among those meanings;
4. stop before implementation planning, Task Breakdown, or mutation.

Do not ask the user for repository facts the Agent can discover. Do not fill a gap with an "implementation assumption". After the answer, update the same
Requirement Contract and repeat only the still-open readiness check.

## Brainstorm Boundary

Requirement brainstorming explores outcomes, actors, models, flows, states,
ordering, interactions, rules, constraints, failure meaning, compatibility, and
observable acceptance. Keep alternatives only when they represent genuinely
different desired contracts. A technical option belongs here only when the
user is choosing a product or architecture constraint that changes behavior,
scope, or acceptance.

Discuss one load-bearing normative topic at a time. For a genuinely unresolved
topic, present the current understanding, decisive factual evidence and
constraints, material risk or trade-off, the Agent's recommendation, and at
most one minimum normative question. Make the content detailed enough for the
decision; do not replace it with a three-line summary or batch confirmation
list. When the Requirement is already clear, ask no question and manufacture no
alternative.

Class names, storage layout, framework choice, task ordering, test framework,
and other ordinary implementation means belong to
[`plan-feature.md`](plan-feature.md) after `implementation-ready`. If a technical
investigation exposes a normative conflict, return here instead of bending the
Requirement to the current code.

## Decision Authority And Source Fidelity

Capture a compact Requirement Decision Delta only when the user selects,
rejects, corrects, or defines load-bearing meaning: trigger/question -> faithful
answer -> `Authority: user-confirmed` -> normative meaning and scope ->
Agent-derived consequences -> affected requirement and acceptance. Replacements
become `superseded`; they never silently rewrite the mainline.

Keep a clear user statement verbatim as `User source`. If readability truly
requires normalization, change only punctuation, obvious typos, grammar, or
word order and keep the original adjacent. Never omit or merge a command,
question, refusal, actor, ownership, timing, uncertainty, emphasis, boundary,
reason, or rejected direction. Label any interpretation as Agent-derived and
subordinate. When durable capture is admitted, apply
[`maintain-docs.md` § Source-Preserving User Input](maintain-docs.md#source-preserving-user-input).

## Requirement Artifact Pressure Gate

Keep the Requirement Contract in the current Session by default. Create or
update the smallest Governing Requirement only when the user explicitly asks
for a Requirement/PRD artifact, or when an independent reader, review,
recovery, validator, lifecycle, or handoff must consume the desired contract.
Complexity, activity, implementation size, or a clear Requirement alone is not
pressure.

Reuse an authoritative existing issue, PRD, accepted decision, or Requirement
instead of duplicating it. Before any new write, prove the destination is the
real project code root and follow its local Requirement archive contract; if
either is unresolved, stop the write rather than placing product truth in a
meta-repository, wrong checkout, or invented taxonomy. Create only the natural
single file or dossier entry that the proven reader needs.

The artifact owns source/authority, desired goal, scope and preservation,
decision-bearing model/flow, rules and constraints, observable acceptance, and
confirmed or superseded normative decisions. Label supporting Current facts as
implementation evidence. Exclude Current -> Target implementation design, Task
Breakdown, task ordering, proof commands, and live step status. Writing the
Requirement does not enter Plan Feature or authorize mutation.

A later durable implementation Plan links to and consumes this owner one way.
Physical co-location may use separate files when the local archive supports it,
but Plan Feature cannot copy, narrow, resolve, or update the Governing
Requirement. A normative change returns here, updates the Requirement through
its authority, reaches `requirement-ready` again, and only then refreshes Plan
projections.

## Handoff

Return the source/authority and, when admitted, the Governing Requirement path;
then return the activated desired contract, known exclusions and
preservation, observable acceptance, current facts versus assumptions, and any
resolved/superseded decisions through the runtime Change Contract. Task
Execution may then project Goal, Done When, and material Boundaries into a Task
Anchor. Requirement Definition does not derive implementation steps.

[workflow-state:requirements]
Resolve only desired meaning. Return `requirement-ready` or one minimum
normative question; an admitted Governing Requirement is still not an
implementation Plan or mutation.
