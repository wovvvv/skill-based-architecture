# Project Rules

- Changes to the sample application must preserve its command-line contract.
- Release-affecting work requires the repository validation workflow before delivery.
- External credentials, deployment, and publication remain outside this project Skill.
- Project-rule changes require explicit user intent and the routed update-rules workflow.
- Task scope does not automatically grant external write authority for databases, deployments, configuration, or shared systems; obtain explicit authorization before performing such writes.
MARKDOWN

    cat > "skills/$name/rules/coding-standards.md" <<'MARKDOWN'
# Coding Standards

- Use kebab-case file names and descriptive shell function names.
- Comment only non-obvious ownership, failure, or recovery boundaries.
- Keep shell scripts compatible with Bash 3.2 unless a checked runtime contract says otherwise.
- Run the repository-owned formatter or syntax check before reporting implementation complete.
- Keep imports and helper ownership local to the smallest responsible module.

# Release Helper

Keep release metadata consistent without introducing additional project machinery.

## Always Read

1. Read `VERSION` before changing release metadata.

## Common Tasks

- Version update: edit `VERSION`, then run `bash scripts/check-version.sh`.
- Other release request: inspect `VERSION`, make the smallest relevant change, and run the same check.

# Path Contract

## Common Tasks

- Reference check: read [inline paths](references/code-owner.md) and
  [heading anchors](references/anchor-owner.md), then run the fitted smoke check.
- Other: inspect the same two owners and report unresolved local references.

## Known Gotchas

- Fenced examples and placeholder/glob notation are examples, not dependencies.

# Project Instructions

## Fix Bug Workflow

Reproduce database failures and run the repository validation script.

## Add Feature Workflow

Implement configuration changes without deploying them to a shared system.

## Review Release Workflow

Review the change and keep deployment approval explicit.

## Known Gotcha

Never infer database, deployment, configuration, or shared-system write authority from local task scope.
