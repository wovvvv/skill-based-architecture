# Reference — Splitting a Skill by Abstraction (骨架 / 肉)

When a `rules/` (or `references/`) file tangles invariant design theory with current-code facts, split it by **abstraction** ([Progressive Rigor](progressive-rigor.md) trigger 3). This is the playbook, distilled from doing it on two real code-coupled skills. It is a *re-tiering of an existing skill*, not the initial scattered→skill migration ([full-migration.md](../workflows/full-migration.md)).

**The judgement test:** *after a big refactor that renames modules and moves files, is this statement still true and useful? Yes → 骨架 (skeleton: invariant theory). It describes the current code — a map / name / path / a landmine at a symbol → 肉 (flesh: current-code facts).*

> Rate of change is a correlated heuristic, but it mislabels **slow-drifting maps** (the module tree) as architecture — they are stable-ish yet they are flesh (a map of the code, not an invariant law). Abstraction is the real cut.

> **Cohesion exception — don't shatter a decision subsystem.** The split distributes by abstraction, but a *tightly-coupled decision subsystem* — a classifier plus the data it classifies — stays cohesive in **one** artifact even when its rows differ in rate-of-change. The permission model's 🔴 rows (invariant) and 🟡 rows (mutable) live in **one** table, not split 🔴→`architecture/` and 🟡→`conventions/`; splitting a decision procedure by rate-of-change makes it un-runnable at a glance and scatters the "what are all my rules" view. Safe because the harm the split guards against — a slow invariant re-churned by fast facts — is a *prose-tangling* harm; a table of discrete rows doesn't tangle (changing one row never forces another). **Cohesion of a decision procedure beats rate-of-change distribution.** (Generic engine still skeleton, project rows still flesh — see §7 two-root; only the tiers *within* the data table stay merged.)

## 1. Classify by abstraction — five buckets

The split is not binary. Going section by section, each lands in one of:

| Bucket | → | Kind | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Abstract design theory** — layering/contract/orchestration **principles**, the "why" (NOT the module map) | `architecture/` | 骨架 | "an existing HTTP contract is a compatibility boundary" |
| **Code maps** — module tree, package/dir layout, source index, the call graph with real symbols | `references/` | 肉 | "modules: web → biz/shared → core → common/dal" |
| Volatile house style — naming, route shapes, paths, commands, formats | `conventions/` | 肉 | "`POST /{entity}/create`", "param names `page`/`limit`" |
| Code-coupled landmines — symptom→cause→fix on specific symbols | `gotchas/` (split by independently routed module only) | 肉 | "change a Controller, rebuild the `start` fat-jar or you run stale bytecode" |
| **Cross-cutting methodology** — mutation discipline, task execution, delegation, AAR triggers | `rules/` or `workflows/` by action timing | 骨架 | `rules/change-discipline.md` before mutation; subagent workflows only when delegation is considered |

**Two buckets get missed.** (1) The **code map** looks like architecture but is flesh — `modules-and-packages.md`, a directory layout, a call graph with class names *describe the current code* and drift on every refactor; they go in `references/`, not `architecture/`. Mixing them in makes `architecture/` diverge (re-describing the code) instead of converging on the few invariant principles. (2) **Methodology** is neither architecture nor convention nor gotcha — place a constraint in `rules/` only when a phase boundary selects it, and a procedure in `workflows/`; do not rebuild a universal behavior bundle. `architecture/` should end up small and sparse: abstraction is compact.

## 2. Author the new files: verbatim, no duplication, cross-link

- **Reproduce technical content verbatim.** Method names, paths, field names, commands, error codes are the value — never paraphrase or summarize a rule or a gotcha.
- **Do not duplicate content that already lives in another tier file.** A new `architecture/api-contract.md` must not re-print the response-envelope mechanism already in `architecture/response-envelope.md` — cross-link (`[[response-envelope]]`) instead. Duplication re-creates the scatter you are trying to fix.
- **Gotchas stay cohesive by root cause and task path.** Start with one routed file or section. Split to a module file such as `gotchas/hotfix.md` only when a real bug task selects it without the other Gotchas; if every caller still co-loads the files, keep or restore one file.
- **Consolidate existing scatter.** If the same concept is stated across several old files (one principle repeated in `rules/` and a pitfall file; a module table duplicated in two references; a rule and its later rollback as separate entries), collapse it into one canonical home in the new tier and cross-link from the rest — don't carry the duplication forward. Likewise **elevate** a stable structural fact that was mis-filed as a gotcha up into `architecture/`, so routing surfaces it.

## 3. A split is a path migration — repoint or stub every old-path reference

Moving content out of `rules/backend-rules.md` or `references/gotchas.md` changes the path other files point at. Before deleting an old file:

1. `grep` for every reference to the old path across `workflows/`, `routing.yaml`, thin shells, and `SKILL.md`.
2. **Repoint** the references you own to the new tier paths.
3. For paths hard-referenced by files you can't or won't edit yet (e.g. assembled/vendored copies), leave a **redirect stub** that points to the new home and *actively corrects the stale instruction* ("record new gotchas in `gotchas/<module>.md`, not here"), then delete it once those references are mirrored.
4. **Delete old files with zero remaining references.** An unreferenced redirect stub is itself an orphan — only keep a stub that something still points at.

> A markdown `[]()` link is validated by `smoke-test`'s link check; a bare path in inline code is not. So a redirect's `[]()` links must resolve, but inline-code path mentions are free.

## 4. Every fine-grained leaf needs a routed path — an index is conditional

There are two different "reachable", and they are easy to conflate:

- **Link-reachable** (what `audit-orphans.sh` checks) — some scanned file mentions the path, so it isn't an orphan. **Necessary but not sufficient.**
- **Route-reachable** (activation) — some task's route actually leads the agent to read it during work.

A file can pass `audit-orphans` (e.g. listed in the `SKILL.md` manifest) yet **never be read**, because it is on no task route. That is "stored, not activated" at fine grain — and it is pure waste: you split the file out for cohesion, but the task that needs it never sees it. Real case: a skill split `architecture/` into 9 files but routed only ~4; `architecture/transactions-locks.md` was link-reachable but on no route, so transactional work never read the transaction invariants.

Choose the lightest route that actually selects the leaf:

- **Activate a known leaf directly from the workflow.** If current evidence identifies transactional work, the owning workflow reads `architecture/transactions-locks.md`; do not make the Agent read an index merely to rediscover an answer the evidence already proved.
- **Add a selecting `index.md` only after multi-file pressure.** Use one when several independently useful leaves exist but the route can identify only the tier/module, not the exact leaf. Its **"read when"** column must map task signals to the next file (`transactions-locks.md → multi-step write / lock / async`). A passive directory list is not activation.
- **Reading an index is not reading the content.** After a routed index, pull the matching leaves or explicitly state that none matched; silently treating index-read as content-read is the failure mode this pattern can create.
- List selected leaves as **inline-code skill-root-relative paths** (e.g. `architecture/transactions-locks.md`) so the same string is both a navigable path and an `audit-orphans` inbound. A relative link to only `transactions-locks.md` lacks the tier prefix and does not satisfy that check.

Do not create an index for one file. If every task that reaches an index selects every leaf, the index is not routing anything: merge the leaves when their meaning is cohesive, or route the known leaves directly when storage boundaries exist for ownership/generation reasons.

## 5. Re-derive routing — the split is also a routing redesign

A move that leaves routing untouched produces incoherent routes.

- **Empty `always_read` unless every workflow truly needs the file before selection.** Mutation discipline, indexes, and code facts do not qualify merely because they are broadly useful.
- **Re-derive each workflow's activation points** around the smallest evidenced leaves, or a selecting index only when evidence identifies the tier but not the leaf (§4). The classic failure remains: `fix-bug` found a symptom but never activated the architecture rule needed to interpret it — half an answer.

## 6. Validate

- `audit-orphans.sh` → **0 orphans** (every tier file is link-reachable).
- `route-reachability.sh` → **0 unreachable** (every active-tier file and workflow is route-reachable — directly on a route or through a routed selecting index/reference, §4).
- `smoke-test.sh <name>` → tier checks pass (`constraint surface` across rules/architecture/conventions; gotchas tier recognized); `routing.yaml` ≤ 140 lines.
- `route-health.sh <name>` → no routing-quality smells.

## 7. Scaling the split across two repos (skill_root / code_root)

The abstraction line above is also the natural **repo boundary**. When one skill's skeleton is *shared* — the same `architecture/` + `workflows/` + `rules/` serve many code checkouts, or a tool assembles the skill into each consumer's tool dir — split the skill across **two roots**, cut on the same 骨架/肉 line:

| Root | Owns | Why there |
|---|---|---|
| **`skill_root`** (shared / upstream "元仓") | `SKILL.md`, `routing.yaml`, `architecture/`, `rules/`, `workflows/` — skeleton + entry + routing — plus the checkout-invariant slice of `gotchas/` / `references/` (see below) | invariant; one copy, assembled/vendored to each consumer |
| **`code_root`** (per-codebase facts) | `conventions/`, `gotchas/`, `references/` — flesh | drifts with the code; lives in the code repo so it changes in the **same PR** as the code it describes |

No new concept — the skeleton/flesh cut you already make *inside* a Full skill (§1) is just drawn at the repo boundary instead.

**Which root? — the checkout-coupling test.** *Could this content legitimately differ between two simultaneously active checkouts (branches / release lines) of the code repo?* Yes → `code_root` (it must travel with the checkout it describes). No — identical for every checkout → `skill_root`. This test decides **repo placement only**; tier membership still follows §1's abstraction test. The two axes answer different questions and may disagree on the same item — that is legal, not a contradiction: the `start` fat-jar gotcha from §1 is *flesh by tier* (it names symbols; a refactor invalidates it) yet *skill_root by coupling* (the toolchain landmine holds on every checkout). So `gotchas/` and `references/` are **not** wholesale code_root: framework/toolchain-mechanism landmines that hold for every checkout live in the skill_root's own `gotchas/`, while symbol-and-state-coupled landmines stay in `code_root` — a mixed file goes where its majority lives, with a note flagging the minority entries for re-check when the implementation moves. Do **not** use the coupling test as a tier test — "same on every branch" does not make a code map architecture (§1's warning about slow-drifting maps applies unchanged).

**Routing and workflows join the two roots with a source prefix.** `routing.yaml` lives in `skill_root`, declares a `path_resolution` block, and selects one prefixed workflow. That workflow can later activate `skill:` architecture or `code:` facts after evidence reaches their scope; business owners use the separately timed `domain-routing.yaml`.

```yaml
path_resolution:
  skill_root:        # shared skeleton, assembled into each consumer's tool dir
    owns: [SKILL.md, routing.yaml, architecture/**, rules/**, workflows/**]
  code_root:         # per-codebase flesh, lives in the code repo
    root: apps/<app>/skills/<name>
    owns: [conventions/**, gotchas/**, references/**]

tasks:
  - id: style-ui
    labels: { en: Adjust UI / interaction, zh: 调整前端样式 }
    workflow: skill:workflows/change-managed.md
    trigger_examples: [调整样式, UI 优化, antd 样式]
```

**When NOT to.** A single-repo skill needs neither prefixes nor `path_resolution` — keep the default single-root layout (one `skills/<name>/` dir, plain `workflows/X.md` paths). Two roots pay off only when the skeleton is genuinely shared across ≥ 2 code checkouts or centrally assembled; otherwise it is split-for-its-own-sake.

**What changes under two roots:**

- The `code_root` dir is **not** the entry — its `SKILL.md` is a thin stub that points at `skill_root` (entry / routing / skeleton live upstream).
- `audit-orphans` / `route-reachability` run **per root** with the shared routing manifest and explicit namespace:
  - skill root: `--namespace skill --routing <skill_root>/routing.yaml`
  - code root: `--namespace code --routing <skill_root>/routing.yaml`
  Namespace identity prevents a routed `code:gotchas/x.md` from falsely activating a same-path `skill:gotchas/x.md`; zero-argument mode remains for single-root skills.
- The assembler that materializes `skill_root` into consumer dirs is **project-specific** — SBA specifies the *split + prefix contract*, not the tool.
- When a tier glob (e.g. `gotchas/**`) appears under **both** roots' `owns` (legal per the coupling test above), resolution follows the **path prefix** on each reference (`skill:` / `code:`) — `owns` documents intent; the prefix is the contract the scripts resolve.
- **Cross-repo writes need a guard.** Before a workflow writes into the *other* root (or any path outside the current skill dir), run a literal existence check on the target root (e.g. `test -d <code_root>/.git`) and **stop on failure** — never silently `mkdir` the target tree in whatever repo you happen to be in. (Real downstream failure: docs nearly created at the meta-repo root, where the assembler would never ship them.)
- **The repo root between the two roots is a machine-check blind spot.** Content parked there — shared workflow fragments, protocol-blocks, orchestration docs — is scanned by *neither* root's `audit-orphans` / `route-reachability` / smoke-test, and an assembler that materializes only `skill_root` won't ship it, so repo-root references break silently after assembly (a real downstream shipped a dangling `protocol-blocks/` link exactly this way). Shared fragments must either be materialized by the assembler into each skill, or vendored into each skill **with a mechanical equality check across the copies** — two hand-mirrored copies without one is pseudo-dedup that will silently drift.

## Mechanical notes

- **Watch for assembled / vendored copies.** If the file you're editing is a byte-identical assembled copy of an upstream source (vendor-class, or generated by an assembler), editing it in place gets clobbered on the next sync — confirm the source of truth first.
- **Fanning out the authoring?** If you dispatch one subagent per target file in parallel, **batch ~4 concurrent**. A burst of a dozen+ heavy file-authoring agents reliably trips API connection resets (`ECONNRESET`); small batches do not.
