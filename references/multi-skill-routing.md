# Multi-Skill Routing

When a repo owns **multiple skills** in `skills/` (not just one), the routing, triggering, and resource-sharing conventions need more nuance than the single-skill case. This file covers those.

## When you need multiple skills

A single project skill is enough when the whole project shares one set of rules and one routing manifest. Split into multiple skills when **any** of these is true:

- Two subsystems have **non-overlapping trigger phrases** (a user asking about "billing" and "onboarding" should activate different skills or different canonical task routes)
- Two subsystems have **contradicting rules** (frontend rules say "prefer Web Components", backend rules say irrelevant) — forcing them into one skill loads conflicting constraints on every task
- One subsystem is a **standalone reusable library** that could be extracted later — giving it its own skill is a low-cost pre-split

One skill with multiple domains (`rules/frontend-rules.md` + `rules/backend-rules.md`) is NOT multi-skill — it's one skill covering several domains. Multi-skill means separate `skills/<name>/` directories each with their own SKILL.md + rules + workflows.

**Default shape:** one `primary: true` project skill with workflow routing in its `routing.yaml`. Do **not** create separate skills for ordinary workflow verbs like `fix-bug`, `add-feature`, `review`, or `update-docs`; those are usually `workflows/*.md` under the same project skill because they share project rules, gotchas, validation commands, and Task Closure Protocol.

Split only when the trigger language and rule set form a separate domain: for example `skills/app`, `skills/deploy`, `skills/data-migration`, or `skills/template-builder`. If the proposed child skill still reads the same Always Read files and only differs by procedure, keep it as a workflow.

## The `primary: true` default

With multiple skills, one should be marked `primary: true` in its frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: web-app
description: ...
primary: true
---
```

**Rule:** the primary skill is the default read when a task doesn't clearly match another skill's description. Only one skill per repo gets `primary: true`.

If no skill has `primary: true`, the Agent has to match description-by-description on every task — slower, error-prone.

## Description discipline — no overlapping trigger phrases

With multiple skills, trigger phrases are the disambiguator between domains, not a workflow keyword inventory. Two skills with overlapping triggers guarantee mis-routing.

**Bad** (both fire on "add page"):
```yaml
# skills/frontend/SKILL.md
description: Use when the user asks to "add a page", "fix styling", ...

# skills/cms/SKILL.md
description: Use when the user asks to "add a page", "edit content", ...
```

**Good** (trigger phrases disjoint):
```yaml
# skills/frontend/SKILL.md
description: Use when the user asks to "add a UI page", "style a component", "fix a rendering bug", ...

# skills/cms/SKILL.md
description: Use when the user asks to "add a content page", "edit article", "publish draft", ...
```

**Check:** grep each skill's quoted trigger phrases in every supported user language: `grep -h '"' skills/*/SKILL.md | sort | uniq -d`. Any phrase appearing in two skills → rewrite one. (The earlier `check-description-routing.sh` did this and more; it was removed 2026-05 in favor of a one-line grep + human re-read.)

## Shared resources — where they live in a multi-skill repo

Some resources apply across all skills in the repo:

| Resource | Layout in multi-skill repo |
|---|---|
| Root shells (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.) | ONE set at repo root. Each shell's Always Read preamble is generated from the primary skill's `routing.yaml`. Each shell points to the router / `routing.yaml` manifest rather than carrying copied rows. |
| Protocol-blocks | Single-skill scaffolds vendor them inside `skills/<name>/protocol-blocks/` so workflows link locally. Multi-skill repos may instead share `protocol-blocks/` at repo root, but then they must ensure the assembler materializes the shared blocks or keeps per-skill copies equal; repo-root shared fragments are a machine-check blind spot in two-root layouts ([skeleton-flesh-split.md §7](skeleton-flesh-split.md)). |
| Shared workflow skeleton (sibling skills repeating the same gate text) | Same rule: one physical source linked from every skill, or per-skill vendored copies with an equality check. Extracting a shared core is real dedup only if a machine can prove the copies are equal. |
| Hooks (`.claude/hooks/`) | ONE set at repo root. A hook that gates one skill's file uses env vars or path checks to scope its effect. |
| References | Per-skill under each `skills/<name>/references/`. Only move to repo root if a reference legitimately applies to all skills (rare). |
| `WORKFLOW.md` / migration scripts | Single copy at repo root. Migration is repo-level. |

## Cross-skill references

A workflow in `skills/frontend/workflows/add-page.md` can reference `skills/backend/rules/api-rules.md` when a page consumes an API. The mechanism is just a relative path:

```markdown
Before wiring the API call, read `../../backend/rules/api-rules.md` for the contract conventions.
```

Do NOT duplicate the content into `skills/frontend/rules/`. The cross-reference preserves one source of truth.

**Rule:** if skill A's workflows reference skill B's rules more than twice, evaluate whether those rules belong at repo root in a shared `rules/` directory, or whether the two skills should actually merge.

## Routing under ambiguity — which skill owns this task?

When a user request could match multiple skills, the resolution order:

1. **Explicit user cue** — "in the frontend, ...", "for the billing service, ..." — the Agent picks the named skill unconditionally.
2. **Trigger phrase exact match** — user's verb-noun matches one skill's description word-for-word; pick that skill.
3. **Primary skill fallback** — no cue, no unambiguous match → pick the `primary: true` skill.
4. **Ask the user** — two skills match equally; pick neither, ask "is this a frontend task or a backend task?"

Never "try both" — reading two full SKILL.md's on every ambiguous task is token waste and confuses routing.

**Exception — defect-class requests skip step 3.** Bug ownership is a *fact*, not a preference: for "there's a bug / it's broken" with no ownership cue, the primary fallback systematically mis-routes (every ambiguous defect lands on the primary skill), and step 4 often fails too — the user can't tell either. Instead, run a short **read-only intake** first: reproduce, collect one failing piece of evidence (response, log, rendered state), then route by what the evidence shows. Evidence spanning both skills → declare it cross-skill and drive both skills' workflows against the **same acceptance check**, not one skill's guess. Keep the intake trigger to a routing-level line — obviously-owned defects ("this button's style is wrong") still route directly; don't tax them with intake ceremony.

## Task Closure across skills

When a task's workflow lives in skill A but touches files owned by skill B (e.g., `skills/frontend/workflows/add-page.md` modifies a backend endpoint), the AAR at the end has **two** rule-update targets:

- Learnings about the frontend workflow → `skills/frontend/references/gotchas.md`
- Learnings about the API contract or backend constraint → `skills/backend/references/gotchas.md`

Record in both, not just in the originating skill. The Task Closure Protocol is owner-agnostic; it serves whichever skill's knowledge the learning belongs to.

## Fission signals — when to split a single skill into multiple

Signs that a single skill is ready to split:

- `SKILL.md` > 100 lines and can't compress without losing routing detail
- Trigger phrases cluster into two or more disjoint groups (no user ever asks a task that crosses groups)
- `rules/` has 6+ files and 3+ of them are never read together on the same task
- One subsystem's AAR entries don't teach anything useful to the other subsystem

Fission mechanics:

- **Domains independent?** — Subdomains (e.g. frontend vs. backend) have rules that don't affect each other.
- **Description too broad?** — Agent frequently matches the skill for tasks that only touch one subdomain.
- **Task routing overloaded?** — `routing.yaml` exceeds 10 entries, most tasks only use one subdomain's files.

All three Yes → split into separate skills under `skills/`. Move shared rules to `skills/shared/`.

**When to rebuild a skill from scratch instead of splitting.** Sometimes a skill has drifted so far that patching it costs more than starting over. Evaluate rebuild when 2+ of these are true:

1. **> 30% of rules outdated or contradictory** — rules conflict with each other or describe removed features
2. **Canonical task routing is fictional** — 3+ `routing.yaml` routes point to workflows/files that no longer match real project work
3. **Generated routing hooks have drifted** — generated Always Read, the Common Tasks action hook, or shell bootstraps disagree with `routing.yaml`, or manual re-alignment keeps failing
4. **Repeated agent errors trace back to "confusing rules"** — the last 5+ agent mistakes were caused by the rules themselves being unclear, not by missing rules

Rebuild path: `cp -R templates/skill/. skills/<name>/` to get a fresh skeleton, then manually migrate only the rules and gotchas that are still valid. Do not copy-paste the old structure — re-evaluate each piece through the recording threshold before including it.

## Coexistence rules

When a repo has multiple skills (e.g. `skills/app/` + `skills/template-builder/` + optional `skills/shared/`):

1. **Independent entries** — each skill has its own `SKILL.md`, self-contained, no implicit cross-dependencies.
2. **Registration + auto-discovery** — each skill must have a `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` registration entry for Cursor discovery, plus thin shells with `routing.yaml` bootstraps for Claude/Codex. Adding a skill = dropping a folder into `skills/` + creating the registration entry + updating thin shells.
3. **Priority** — when a task clearly belongs to one skill, that skill's rules take precedence; if ambiguous, Agent reads both skills' Always Read lists.
4. **Shared rules** — conventions shared across skills (e.g. coding standards) go in `skills/shared/`; each skill's SKILL.md references them in its Always Read list.
5. **Don't merge** — if two skills have very different domains (e.g. "app development" vs "template building"), keeping them separate is clearer than forcing a merge.

**Monorepo variant:** in a monorepo with `packages/` or `apps/`, put skills at the **workspace root** (`skills/`). A single `skills/shared/` holds cross-package conventions; each package-level skill (`skills/pkg-a/`) adds package-specific rules. Auto-discovery still works — agents scan all `skills/*/SKILL.md` and match by description.

## Anti-patterns

- **Creating multiple skills for a single-domain project just because it feels modular.** If the skills always read each other's files on every task, the split is fake. Merge.
- **Workflow-as-skill explosion.** `skills/fix-bug`, `skills/add-feature`, `skills/review`, and `skills/update-docs` usually duplicate the same project rules and compete for activation. Keep them as workflows unless their rules and trigger language truly diverge.
- **Listing every skill's rules in every shell's Always Read preamble.** Pollutes every session with everyone else's rules. Only the primary skill's Always Read goes in the shell preamble; other skills are routed to explicitly.
- **Identical description text across skills.** The Agent can't distinguish. Every skill's description must be uniquely identifying.
- **`primary: true` on multiple skills.** The `primary` is an exclusive designation; more than one is a config bug.
- **Non-workflow route — `workflow:` contains prose or points to a navigation-only section.** A task route must select one real procedure, not hide "scan files and decide" instructions in the field or point back to `SKILL.md` principles. Point it at a `workflows/*.md` owner with ordered steps. Symptom: you cannot name the procedure the route adds beyond "look around."
- **Task-size as a sibling task.** A "this is a big/multi-subtask run" entry routes by *size*, not intent, so it competes with every intent route (a large migration matches both the migration route and the long-run route). Make it a cross-cutting modifier layered on the matched route, not a standalone task.

## Example layout (3-skill repo)

```
repo-root/
├── AGENTS.md              ← single thin shell, routes to all 3 skills
├── CLAUDE.md
├── CODEX.md
├── GEMINI.md
├── .cursor/rules/workflow.mdc
├── .cursor/skills/         ← registration entries for each
│   ├── web-app/SKILL.md
│   ├── billing/SKILL.md
│   └── admin-cli/SKILL.md
├── protocol-blocks/        ← shared across all 3 skills
│   ├── reboot-check.md
│   └── subagent-contract.md
├── .claude/
│   ├── settings.json       ← one hook config for the repo
│   └── hooks/*
└── skills/
    ├── web-app/            ← primary: true
    │   ├── SKILL.md
    │   ├── rules/
    │   ├── workflows/
    │   └── references/
    ├── billing/
    │   └── ...
    └── admin-cli/
        └── ...
```

The router's manifest shows rows for all three skills, each prefixed by the skill name so the Agent knows which `skills/<name>/` to read for that task.
